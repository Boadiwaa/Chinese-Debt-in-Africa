## Overview of Report {.tabset}

### Description
This is a brief descriptive report highlighting some finds from a quick analysis of a Kaggle Dataset on Chinese Debt in 50 countries from Africa. There were 1188 observations in the dataset with 7 variables named: "S.no","Project","Year",         "Lender","$ Allocation","Country" and "Invested On". 

The major variable of interest was the Allocation (Debt) amount in dollars.

<br>

### **Contents of the Report:**

- Biggest Lenders(allocation-wise)
- Frequent Borrowers
- How the 50 African countries fared in terms of borrowing
- Most Invested Sectors
- Each Country's Biggest Loan
- Lending trend over the years
- Top 5 borrowers vs. Bottom 5 borrowers
- Spending Behavior of the Top 3 Borrowers
- Zooming in on West Africa
- Sneak Peek on Ghana

                  cda$`$ Allocation`)), Year=as.Date(as.character(Year), format = "%Y"))

```

<br>

## Biggest Lenders

```{r }
cda %>% group_by(Lender) %>% summarize(Total=sum(Allocation)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))%>% slice_head(n=10) %>% 
  mutate(Amt=label_number_si(accuracy=0.1,prefix="$")(Total),
         .keep="unused") %>% 
kable(caption = "Table 1: Top 10 Lenders to Africa and Total Loan Amount", col.names = c("Chinese Lender", "Loan Amount"))

```

<br>

## Top 10 Frequent Borrowers

```{r }
cda %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarize(Frequency=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Frequency))%>% mutate(Rank=seq(1,50))%>% relocate(Rank) %>% 
  slice_head(n=10) %>%
kable(caption = "Table 2: Africa's Fequent Borrowers", col.names = c("Rank", "Country", "Frequency of Loan Entries"))

```

<br>

## The African Countries and Their Total Loan Amounts
```{r }
cda %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarize(Total=sum(Allocation)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))%>% 
  mutate(Rank=seq(1,50), Amt=label_number_si(accuracy=0.1,prefix="$")(Total),.keep="unused") %>% relocate(Rank) %>% 
kable(caption = "Table 3: African Countries and the Total Amount Borrowed", col.names = c("Rank","Country", "Loan Amount" ))

```

<br>

## Most Invested Sectors
```{r }
cda %>% group_by(`Invested On`) %>% summarize(Total=sum(Allocation)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))%>% 
  mutate(Rank=seq(1,21), Amt=label_number_si(accuracy=0.1,prefix="$")(Total),.keep="unused") %>% relocate(Rank) %>% 
kable(caption = "Table 4: Sectors and The Amounts Invested", 
      col.names = c("Rank","Sector", "Loan Amount"))

``` 

<br>

## Each Country's Biggest Loan
```{r}
cda %>% arrange(desc(Allocation),Country) %>% 
  select(Project: `Invested On`) %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% slice_head(n=1)%>% 
kable(caption = "Table 5: Details on the Biggest Loan Per Country") 
``` 

<br>

## Lending trend over the years

```{r,a}

``` 

<br>

## Top 5 vs Bottom 5 Borrowers
The following two charts compares the borrowing patterns of the highest and lowest borrowers in Africa.The colored ribbon shows the 95% confidence interval and the colored line represents the linear regression model.

Aside the noticeable difference in the amounts usually borrowed, there is a stark contrast in the frequency of borrowing. *(NB: Some outliers were taken out so the highest value on the y-axis does not indicate the highest amount borrowed.)

```{r,b}

```  

<br>

## Most Invested vs Least Invested Sector (by the top 3 borrowers)

As shown below, Africa's top 3 borrowers spent the most on **Mining** and the least on the **Environment**. Quite ironic!
```{r,c}

``` 

<br>

## Spotlight on West Africa
Here's an overview of how the 16 countries in West Africa fared:
The first graph gives a sense of the usual borrowed amounts per country, and the 2nd shows the total amount borrowed over the period per country. 

```{r,d}

```

## Ghana's Tale

At the tail of this report, we take a quick peek at Ghana. We look at Ghana's investment patterns and see the sad story of its most invested area.
